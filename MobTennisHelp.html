It shows their name and their win streak (link). Click on the name to change it and rename the character! Pressing the profile will go to the customisation section (link)</li><li><strong>Win streak</strong> - this shows the amount of games his character has one in a row</li><li><strong>Coins</strong> - this shows the coins you can get by playing. It costs some coins to play online, but if you win you get more! Coins can be also collected at regular intervals using the free coins button or bought (link) with real world money. Think of this as a donation to help pay for more features in this awesome game, as developers need food and shelter too.</li><li><strong>Player slots</strong> - here are all the players that will take part in the match. You can add and remove players using the plus or minus buttons on each slot (image). Reorder them by dragging them about. Sometimes they get stuck though but if that happens you can always add and remove them more until they stop being confused. If there is no-one in the slot it will be replaced by AI driven robots (the good kind), or if you have set it to be an online match, hopefully by other humans found on the interweb. If you see a grey image (image) this is because the match setup needs this slot reserved for an online person. There always needs to be a player in slot one so you can't remove them. You can edit them though by pressing the pencil button (image) which will take you to the customisation screen (link).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Match settings</strong> - there are three options about how you can configure the match:</li><li><strong>Singles (One Vs One) or Doubles (Two Vs Two)</strong> - this sets the amount of players on court&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Offline or Online</strong> - this says you want to play Offline on you phone against AI robots (the good kind) or your friends, or Online, which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can do with one friend too in a team, against other challengers online generally to be the best and be given glory</li><li><strong>Single match or tournament</strong> - this states if you will play on game or a few in a row against a whole host of people tournaments are only available offline for now.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Notifications</strong> - if you have a message to read. Right now it is unlikely you will.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Friends</strong> - here you can add friends. If we have this working.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Options</strong> - this opens up the options menu (link)</li><li><strong>Play button</strong> - this is what it is all about.

This other game is better and you don't even do some things I like! How do I tell you this?</strong></p><p>We would also love to hear from you too and will try our best to change your mind! Please send us any thoughts at <a href="mailto:contact@restartworld.com ">contact@restartworld.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I rename my character?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Move the character into the player one slot on the front end and click on the name of the profile in the top corner. (Picture)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I get a refund?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For iOS, unfortunately you need to speak to apple – see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084</a>. For Android, we will need the email address you made purchases with for the refund – send those to <a href="mailto:contact@restartworld.com">contact@restartworld.com</a> and let us know why you were not happy with your purchase and we will see what we can do!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I restore my save file?</strong></p><p>At the moment, we don’t store user specific data for security reasons so have no way of storing your save file. This is something we are considering adding to the game though! Really sorry if you lose your save file, if this is the case, there is not much we can do but support our new attempt to raise to the top!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I transfer my save file onto a new device?</strong></p><p>For iOS, this should happen if you backup your device before moving over. If you are on Android, there maybe third party software that does this. Again, we do not store save files so are limited with what we can do until this feature is implemented.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hey, I wanted that colour when I play online!!! What gives?</strong></p><p>You wanted that colour but so did someone else. The colours are assigned sort of at random so sorry. We hope you can embrace the new colour though.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>That’s not the court I picked out! Where did it go?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When playing online, we change the court to one place, it is sort of random who’s court it is</p><p><br></p></div>
